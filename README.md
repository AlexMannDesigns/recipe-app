A recipe app I built in react, using the Edamam recipe search API: https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api

I moved my API info into a config file, and considered building a back-end to keep them secure. However, I've decided not to hide them so that this can be easily presented on github pages.

Inspired by this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9T6YkEDkMo
I decided to take it further by adding some more functionality and styles.
